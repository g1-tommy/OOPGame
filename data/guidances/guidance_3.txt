In that relation, we can use B's methods(behaviour) and fix them.
And the gorilla want to punch enemy in a nicer way than the enemy.
Then we should fix the __________________ method in ___________________ class.

We didn't decide how to explain 'Overloading' concept.
(class has to start with capital)
