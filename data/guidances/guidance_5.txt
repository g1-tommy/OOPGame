So, why we have to use encapsulation? For security. And there are three steps for encapsulation.

First step : make all instance variable 'private'
Second step : make 'Getter and Setter'
Last step : Put 'Guardian' in the Setter.

Then, fill the blank!!

_____ double weight;
  
	// Setter
	public void ___ Age(int age)
	{
	// Guardian
	  If(age > 0)
	   This.age = age;
	}
	
	//Getter
	public int ___Age()
	{
	 return this.age;
	}
